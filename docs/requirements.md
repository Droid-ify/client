- The system MUST display installation progress and results
- The system SHOULD support batch update/install/uninstall operations

#### App Updates
- The system MUST detect and notify users about available updates
- The system MUST allow users to ignore specific app updates

### Privacy Features

#### Tracking Protection
- The system SHOULD provide privacy scores for applications
- The system SHOULD track and display third-party trackers in applications
- The system SHOULD allow users to block known trackers [Not required]

#### Permissions Analysis
- The system SHOULD analyze and display permission usage of applications
- The system SHOULD highlight potentially dangerous permissions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

#### Responsiveness
- The application MUST remain responsive during repository synchronization
- The application MUST handle large repositories (10,000+ apps) without significant performance degradation
- The application MUST optimize startup time to under 2 seconds on mid-range devices

#### Resource Usage
- The application SHOULD use less than 100MB of memory during normal operation
- The application SHOULD minimize battery consumption during background operations
- The application MUST implement efficient caching for downloaded data

### Security Requirements

#### Data Protection
- The system MUST securely store sensitive data
- The system MUST implement proper encryption for sensitive data at rest
- The system MUST validate all downloaded content cryptographically

#### Installation Security
- The system MUST verify APK signatures before installation
- The system MUST display security warnings for potentially unsafe applications
- The system SHOULD implement proper error handling for verification failures

### Usability Requirements

#### User Interface
- The application MUST follow Material Design 3 guidelines
- The application MUST support both light and dark themes
- The application SHOULD support tablet and foldable layouts

#### Localization
- The application MUST support multiple languages
- The application SHOULD use string resources for all user-facing text
- The application SHOULD support right-to-left languages

### Compatibility Requirements

#### Android Version Support
- The application MUST support Android API level 21 (Android 5.0) and above
- The application SHOULD gracefully handle feature availability on different Android versions
- The application MUST adapt to different screen sizes and densities

#### Network Conditions
- The application MUST function in offline mode for previously downloaded content
- The application SHOULD handle poor network conditions gracefully
- The application MUST allow users to configure network usage (Wi-Fi only, etc.)

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Requirements
- The system MUST follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- The system MUST implement the Repository pattern for data access
- The system SHOULD use Room for database operations
- The system SHOULD implement proper dependency injection with Hilt

### Code Quality Requirements
- The codebase MUST maintain unit test coverage of at least 70%
- The codebase MUST pass static analysis checks (Detekt, ktlint)
- The codebase SHOULD include integration tests for critical flows
- The codebase SHOULD include UI tests for main user journeys

### Documentation Requirements
- The codebase MUST include KDoc comments for public APIs
- The project MUST maintain up-to-date architecture documentation
- The project SHOULD include diagrams for major components
- The project SHOULD document design decisions and patterns used
