# Fullcodes-Apps

### A client for the Fullcodes F-Droid Repository.

## Information

This is a fork that changes only a bit of the original app.
Go support the original developer here: [Here](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client)

I made this fork to add an install flag to the Shizuku Installer.
Now it's possible to downgrade debuggable apps. (Which is a good thing when testing development builds)

## License

Same as the original app: [Here](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client)
