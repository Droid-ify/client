# Fullcodes-Apps

### An F-Droid client for the Fullcodes Repository.

## Information

This is a fork that changes only a bit of the original app.
Go support the original developer here: [Here](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client)

I made this fork to add an install flag to the Shizuku Installer.
It's possible to downgrade debuggable apps now. (Which is a good thing when testing development builds)

## License

Same as the original app: [Here](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client)
